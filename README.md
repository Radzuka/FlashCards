# FlashCards by Radzuka
small console app school project

This script reads csv's written in the form "question";"answer" ,
then displays the options, lets you choose which flashcards do you 
want to use. It asks you if your answer was correct and counts your 
success rate.

## There are two flashcard sets available:
    - periodic table of elements (Czech)
    - personal psychology basics (Czech)

#### Possible expansions:
    - new Flashcard sets (it's easy to make the csv)
    - implementing the possibility to shuffle wrong answers again 
      and again to the point where user got 100 % score
